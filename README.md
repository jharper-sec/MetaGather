## MetaGather

MetaGather is a cross-platform library designed to gather environment metadata. Written in Rust, this library is intended to run on various operating systems and architectures without any external dependencies. It also provides bindings for multiple high-level programming languages, making it versatile and easy to integrate into different environments.

### Project Goals

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation ensures no reliance on external libraries.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to support new data sources and platforms.
- **Language Bindings**: Plans to support Python, JavaScript, Bash, PowerShell, PHP, Ruby, and more.
